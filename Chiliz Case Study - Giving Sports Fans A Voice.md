# Chiliz Case Study – Giving Sports Fans A Voice 

## Abstract 

One of the problems with being a sports enthusiast today is the average fan has limited influence on the beloved teams they support. The majority of sports teams are owned and managed by an exclusive group of wealthy individuals and large corporations. Except for a few teams, sports fans are limited to showing their support either as spectators or as consumers of team merchandise. The following case study lays out how Malta based company, Chiliz, is revolutionizing fan engagement by giving sports fans a voice through Fan Tokens. Founded in 2018, Alexandre Drefus and the Chiliz team saw an opportunity to provide “billions of sports fans direct voting power within their favorite sports organizations”.[[1]](#1) The concept was inspired by democratically managed teams like Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, FC Bayern Munich and the Green Bay Packers, which are some of the most valuable sports organizations in the world. It has been well documented that a key reason for these teams’ success is the direct participation of their fan base.[[2]](#2)

## Company Overview
The Chiliz platform builds on the idea of democratic decision making by adding a digital feature that allows fans to "crowd-manage" their favorite teams, games, leagues and events. Utilizing blockchain technology, fans can vote on various team decisions by purchasing Fan Tokens on the Chiliz’s Socios app. These Fan Tokens are digital assets that are finite, fungible and specific to a team or organization that has partnered with Chiliz. As one token equals one vote, the more tokens an individual owns the more influence they have on their team up to a certain cap. Each team can also set various reward tiers that unlock access to VIP benefits and discounts depending on the number of tokens a fan owns.  In addition to providing a specific utility, Fan Tokens can be bought, sold or traded on the Socios platform with Chiliz’s own native currency called Chiliz Tokens (CHZ). The native CHZ token can be purchased directly on the Socios app with fiat money or exchanged for various other cryptocurrencies on third party exchanges.
    
Since 2018, Chiliz has rapidly grown to a staff of over 80 employees whose backgrounds include sports, gaming, entertainment and payment solutions. Their main headquarters are in Malta with development offices in France, Turkey, Spain, South Korea, Brazil and they recently announced the opening of an office in New York. They also have team members who are active in the UK & Sweden. The CHZ token is now listed on over 8 different crypto exchanges globally and already has a total market cap of approximately US$2.8Billion.[[3]](#3) To date, Chiliz has partnered with 16 professional soccer clubs, 4 e-sports teams, the UFC and Professional Fighting League. Notable teams include FC Barcelona (BAR), Juventus (JUV), Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), Atletico de Madrid (ATM), recently signed Manchester City (CITY) and esports giant OG (OG). 

Initial funding for Chiliz was through a Private Placement of CHZ tokens in the first half of 2018 for approximately US$66Million. CHZ tokens were sold in Fiat, Bitcoin & Ether to key partners including top Asian blockchain investors: Binance, OK Blockchain Capital, Ceyuan Ventures(Feng Bo), FBG Capital and H&S Financial Group.  The company expects to be sufficiently funded for multiple years without the need to generate any meaningful return as it is still in its growth phase.[[4]](#4) That being said, Chiliz has already generated US$30M of revenue in 2020 and anticipate over US$60M in 2021.[[5]](#5)

## Business Activities

### Business Solution

Today, the majority of fan engagement is limited to either attending live events, purchasing team merchandise or watching games at home.  At its core, the Chiliz platform opens up a new channel of engagement where fans can actively participate in key decisions that were traditionally reserved only for a select group of stakeholders (media corporations, corporate sponsors, independent wealthy investors, etc.). With the creation of Fan Tokens, fans now have the ability to vote on anything from new uniform designs, team logos, players of the game, exhibition line-ups, etc. Teams also benefit from the Chiliz platform, as they can now connect directly with their entire fan audience. As an example, Juventus stadium only seats approximately 41,000 fans and has approximately 60 Million followers across their digital channels. With the JUV token, they can now reach all 400M global fans.[[7]](#7) To help bridge the gap, Chiliz also launched The Socios.com MatchDay Experience, which gives fans an opportunity to showcase their in-home cheers. Fan videos are recorded in real time and displayed on the jumbo screen at live games. MatchDay also offers fans holding team tokens exclusive access to live videos of players pre-game routines from leaving the hotel on gameday to locker-room clips and pre-game warmups. 

### Market Opportunity

According to The Business Research Company, the Global Sports Market is anticipated to be worth US$614Billion by 2022 with the spectator market accounting for the fastest growth reaching almost US$270Billion.[[8]](#8) Fan engagement specifically is expected to be a huge growth area. With the emergence of new digital platforms and social media, organizations have been looking to monetize these new engagement channels (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.).  With Chiliz, teams can raise money for various projects by issuing fan tokens and also promote merchandise sales more directly with token discounts. In terms of market opportunity, Chiliz potential customers span the entire sports world. Soccer, which they have already established a strong reputation in, has a global fan base of 3.5 billion people. They have already partnered with 19 different teams and held 11 different Fan Token Offerings. They have pursued the rapidly growing e-sports market, which now has 300 million fans and over 2 billion amateur gamers.[[9]](#9) They hope to expand into cricket with over 1.5 billion potential fans. And recently, management announced that they will be investing $50M to pursue the NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and MLS sports market.[[10]](#10)   


### Competition – Competitive Advantage

As this is a very young market, Chiliz specifically does not have any direct competitors who are currently tokenizing fan influence through blockchain technology. To date, Chiliz is the only company that has partnered with sports teams that are looking to strengthen fan outreach. The company has benefitted from a very strong 'first mover advantage' by signing big teams to work exclusively on their platform. The Chiliz ecosystem also benefits from a network effect. As more teams and partners get added to the platform, liquidity for CHZ & individual Fan Tokens improves. This makes it even harder for incoming competitors to duplicate. Chiliz biggest adversary will likely be individual teams or leagues choosing to create their own Fan Tokens on their own networks. That said, individual teams or leagues would face serious hurdles in terms of the time, cost and expertise needed to build a reliable platform. A smaller network might also lack sufficient liquidity if it can only exchange tokens within its own community where as the Chiliz token offers liquidity across all teams and sports leagues. 

### Technology

The technology that powers the Chiliz and Socios.com platform is a combination of existing blockchain protocols, including Ethereum and Binance blockchains, with their own private permissioned sidechain protocol. The native CHZ currency runs on the Ethereum main-net blockchain with an ERC20 standard while the individual Fan Tokens operate on a private permissioned Proof-of-Authority (PoA) sidechain. The PoA sidechain specifically is where the true ingenuity of the platform exits.  PoA is different from other consensus mechanisms in that it assigns specific actors the authority to confirm transactions. On the Chiliz network, individual teams represent these actors or nodes on the network. The advantage of having a private PoA sidechain, is it enables scalability without incurring high gas fees by going through the Ethereum main-net. Proof-of-Work (PoW) for instance requires extensive computing power to solve difficult mathematical problems that validate transactions. PoA also enables faster transaction times and it gives teams the ability to attach various executable smart contracts to its Fan Tokens that are transparent and auditable by the public. Lastly, the permissioned component of the blockchain, adds an additional level of security, that gives teams access control. Only certain identifiable participants are able to read, access and write information on these blockchains regardless if they are public or private chains.  

Thanks to blockchain, all votes take place in a secure environment and are registered on the blockchain, so the results are transparent and can't be altered. European football is notorious for corruption amongst players, executives and clubs, as salaries and secret deals are kept out of the purview of the public eye. In 2015, the website “Football Leaks” released documents explaining the controversial practice of Third Party Ownership structures, which allow external parties to buy a stake in promising young players. These Third Party investors can impose significant influence on players' and teams' decisions in order to maximize profits. Brazilian footballer, Neymar da Silva Santos Junior, for example, was sold by Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain for US$250M in 2017.[[11]](#11) While it may take time before players salaries and ownership positions start showing up on public ledgers, blockchain helps solve this problem of transperency by giving everyone access to the same information. This is particularly why the Chiliz team chose blockchain technology because it offered the most practical way of maintaining voting integrity while also turning voting rights into an ownable commodity. It also offered a scalable solution that was flexible enough to work across sports and e-sports ecosystems. The creation of a native currency also enables users in more restricted markets an opportunity to purchased Fan Tokens.
  
## Cryptocurrency Landscape

Cryptocurrencies as an entire market have exploded in the past 12 months reaching a recent high of over US$1.8Trillion in value and over US$200Billion of value traded in a single 24hour period. While Bitcoin represents approximately 60% of the total market cap, there is a significant market for alternative cryptocurrencies (Alt-Coins) including utility tokens, commodity tokens, security tokens, etc. The total market cap for Alt-Coins is now almost US$700Billion. As a utility token, Chiliz’s success can be seen in its price appreciation. The total market cap went from just over US$100Million at the start of this year to a high of over US$4.0Billion in less than 3-months. It now trades around US$2.8Billion.  As a subsector, the total market cap for Fan Tokens right now is almost US$350Million with FC Barcelona’s Token ($BAR) hitting a total market cap of US$81Million.[[12]](#12)

Chiliz's early success can be attributed to a few key factors. Firstly, the impact of Covid-19 brought an immediate need for sports teams to find new ways to engage their fans as live events were cancelled. Secondly, the lack of competition in this area, meant Chiliz's growth was depended really on the strength of their team and the ability to execute. As mentioned, the staff is quite strong with significant experience in the sports, gaming, entertainment and payment solutions industries. The advisory board also consists of leaders from Facebook, Google, PokerStars and other successful platforms. Based in Malta, the company also has the support of the Maltese Government and is a member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.[[13]](#13) Lastly, the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and collectibles has also helped grow the entire digital sports & entertainment marketplace. An estimated US$230Million of gross revenue has already come from the sale of NBA highlights sold as NFTs and a single digital art piece sold for US$69Million.[[14]](#14),[[15]](#15) As NFT’s continue to become more mainstream, it seems so will Chiliz’s Fan Tokens.  



### Future Opportunities
Chiliz has even mentioned on their YouTube channel that they are currently developing their own NFT, but have not yet announced how it might be used. Potential opportunities for them include team specific memorabilia that fans can bid on. For example, Cristiano Ronaldo was recently awarded 770 Juventus Fan Tokens to honor him scoring his 770th goal after breaking Pele’s record of 767.[[16]](#16) Instead of awarding Team Tokens, Chiliz could develop a specific NFT Memorabilia Token that honors the 770 goals scored that fans could then bid on. The Memorabilia Token could be attached to the cleats or jersey Christiano wore during the game. Fans would use the Chiliz token to then bid on the Memorabilia Token. The winner would receive both the proof of ownership & authenticity represented by the token and the actual physical memorabilia. Another potential opportunity would be NFT tickets to live events. The NFT game day tickets or season's tickets could be tiered and would grant holders specific access to VIP areas in the stadium, team locker rooms and exclusive events with the players. In fact, Chiliz is already somewhat exploring this space as they have developed the Socios Pass. By uploading a government issued ID to your account, fans can go through a quick verification process at the gates by scanning a QR code. The Socios Pass acts somewhat like a passport, which allows teams to verify who’s in the stadium for security reasons. This would also help prevent ticket fraud, which is a huge issue at live events. 

## Summary
In less than 3 years since Chiliz launched, it is evident the impact they are having in the sports community. They have partnered with some of the biggest sports franchises and have already delivered real value to these organizations. From a financial standpoint, Chiliz has already generated US$30M for its partners and intends to double that revenue stream in 2021.[[17]](#17) The demand for these tokens is also apparent given the rise in market value of Fan Tokens and the fact that they typically sellout within a few hours of being offered to the public. Thanks to Chiliz, sports fans are finally being given an opportunity to have real influence on the teams they love. To date, fans have already voted on over 120 different team polls. Fans were able to select Blur’s iconic Song 2, as the official goal celebration song for Juventus.  Appollon FC fans were even given the opportunity to vote on the starting line-up against Aris Limassol in an exhibition match.[[18]](#18)  It turns out the fans were quite well-informed, as the team won 6-0. In terms of future potential, Chiliz hopes to onboard hundreds of teams in the next few years across multiple sports platforms and create a one-stop marketplace for fans to buy a voice in the organizations they love.
